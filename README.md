# sample_code

1) SYS 3062, Lab 7

   TriangularRobot.m, velocity_model.m, MoveRobotPID_Euler.m, MoveRobotPID_ODE45.m
   
   Description: cruise control behavior for 1D car model using velocity model (v' = c/mu - yv) and PID controller.
   Velocity model is implemented using Euler's method and ODE45 method

2) CS 2150, Lab 3 Stacks

   StackNode.h, StackNode.cpp, stack.h, stack.cpp, postfixCalculator.h, postfixCalculator.cpp, testPostfixCalc.cpp
   
   Description: implemented a stack data structure with a stacknode; push(), top(), pop(), isEmpty() methods;
   postfixcalculator with pushNum(), getTop(), add(), sub(), multiply(), divide(), and negate() methods; and 
   testPostfixCalc.cpp program   

3) CS 2150, Lab 6 Hashing

   hashTable.h, hashTable.cpp, timer.h, timer.cpp, wordPuzzle.cpp, Makefile
   
   Description: implemented a hash table under a word puzzle problem, and using a Makefile to compile. Timer used to determine 
   if hashing function is efficient enough.
   
   Note: was given skeleton files, so not ALL code is 100% mine

4) SYS 6018, Homework 2 Supervised Learning

   hw2.Rmd, hw2.html
   
   Description: basics of supervised learning with polynomial regression, bootstrapping, cross-validation, and k-nearest neighbor modeling.


5) SYS 6018, Homework 6 Clustering

   hw6.Rmd, hw6.html

   Description: applying clustering to customer data and basics of poisson mixture model


6) SYS 6018, Final Project

   project.Rmd, project.html

   Description: final project with a topic of my personal choosing. Having worked with time series data for my undergraduate senior capstone 
   project, I was curious to explore the many ways to interpolate for missing data in time series.
